## What is Kyuubi?

Apache Kyuubiâ„¢ is a distributed and multi-tenant gateway to provide serverless
SQL on data warehouses and lakehouses.

Kyuubi provides a pure SQL gateway through Thrift JDBC/ODBC interface for end-users to manipulate large-scale data with pre-programmed and extensible Spark SQL engines. This "out-of-the-box" model minimizes the barriers and costs for end-users to use Spark at the client side. At the server-side, Kyuubi server and engines' multi-tenant architecture provides the administrators a way to achieve computing resource isolation, data security, high availability, high client concurrency, etc.
